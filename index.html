            <p>The fire service said the cat, named Coconut, remained in a safe position along the riverbank while two firefighters "got rigged into water rescue flood suits".</p>
            <p>It said the firefighters, Sam Hunt and Dom Lever, reunited the cat with its owner, adding they were "lucky enough to get away without a single scratch mark". </p>

            <p>On Facebook, the fire service said: "You would be forgiven for thinking we mainly rescue cats from trees, but not on this occasion.</p>
            <p>"Apart from being a little soggy, Coconut was in good health and was swiftly reunited with their owners. The crew were lucky enough to also get away without a single scratch mark from this ordeal."</p>

                    Winter. Time to eat fat <br>
                    and watch hockey. In the pewter mornings, the cat,<br>
                    a black fur sausage with yellow<br>
                    Houdini eyes, jumps up on the bed and tries<br>
                    to get onto my head. It’s his<br>
                    way of telling whether or not I’m dead.<br>
                    If I’m not, he wants to be scratched; if I am<br>
                    He’ll think of something. He settles<br>
                    on my chest, breathing his breath<br>
                    of burped-up meat and musty sofas,<br>
                    purring like a washboard. Some other tomcat,<br>
                    not yet a capon, has been spraying our front door,<br>
                    declaring war. It’s all about sex and territory,<br>
                    which are what will finish us off<br>
                    in the long run. Some cat owners around here<br>
                    should snip a few testicles. If we wise<br>
                    hominids were sensible, we’d do that too,<br>
                    or eat our young, like sharks.<br>
                    But it’s love that does us in. Over and over<br>
                    again, He shoots, he scores! and famine<br>

                <p class="poetry">crouches in the bedsheets, ambushing the pulsing<br>
                eiderdown, and the windchill factor hits<br>
                thirty below, and pollution pours<br>
                out of our chimneys to keep us warm.<br>
                February, month of despair,<br>
                with a skewered heart in the centre.<br>
                I think dire thoughts, and lust for French fries<br>
                with a splash of vinegar.<br>
                Cat, enough of your greedy whining<br>
                and your small pink bumhole.<br>
                Off my face! You’re the life principle,<br>
                more or less, so get going<br>
                on a little optimism around here.<br>
                Get rid of death. Celebrate increase. Make it be spring.<br>
